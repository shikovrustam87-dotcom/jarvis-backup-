# Meta (Facebook / Instagram) ads

## First run: the user probably is NOT connected yet

If the adwhispr server shows as needing authentication, or a tool call fails with an authentication error, do NOT apologize and stop — treat connecting as step one:

1. Connecting is free, takes one click, and there are no API keys to manage.
2. Hermes: the first AdWhispr tool call opens a browser for the AdWhispr sign-in (OAuth, nothing to paste). Ask them to finish it, then run /reload-mcp or start a new session so the tools load. If the browser did not open, run /reload-mcp to retry the sign-in.
3. Tell them the payoff: "the second you're connected, I'll set up your Meta campaign — created paused, you approve before anything spends."
4. A free account is enough to start. After they connect, continue right where the request left off.


## Connect once

`connect_ad_account` platform meta returns a browser link (OAuth on Meta's own consent screen). Never ask for tokens in chat.

## Launching

- The user's OWN creatives: `launch_meta_ad`. One image card = single-image ad; 2-10 cards = carousel in that order; one video card = video ad; MIXED cards = a creative test (each card its own ad in one shared ad set, Meta shifts budget to the winner). Cards come from the Creative Library by creativeName (`list_my_creatives`) or a direct URL the user OWNS. Never competitor media.
- An image clone made in the AdWhispr app: `launch_cloned_ad` (clonedAdId from list_my_creatives) — the copy and link are the USER'S OWN, written fresh; competitor copy is never reused.
- Campaign-only shapes: `launch_campaign` platform meta — with a dailyBudgetUsd and objective traffic/sales/awareness/engagement it creates the campaign PLUS a targeted ad set.
- The ad runs from one of the user's Facebook Pages: pageName picks by name; one enabled page is used automatically.

## Objectives and targeting

- Objectives: traffic (default), sales (auto-attaches the account's Meta pixel, optimizes purchases; clear error if no pixel), leads, awareness, engagement. If the goal matters and is unstated, ASK.
- Targeting is opt-in: interests, ages, gender, countries/cities/regions, retargeting audiences — resolve ids with `search_ad_targeting` first (kind interests/locations/audiences/pixels; Meta also creates website-visitor and lookalike audiences). Radius targeting: radiusAddress + radiusKm.
- Editing live copy: launch_meta_ad with editAdId changes message/headline/link in place (before-vs-after preview; the ad re-enters Meta review).

## Launch safety (always applies)

- Every campaign is created PAUSED. Nothing spends until the user resumes it.
- Launch, budget, and resume tools are TWO-STEP: the first call returns a preview plus a confirmToken; show the preview, get the user's explicit OK, then call again with the same args plus that token. Never invent a token.
- `resume_campaign` starts real spend. Surface its warning and confirm before passing the token.
- If the user has not clearly stated the campaign objective, ask them to pick from the valid list instead of guessing.
- Targeting is opt-in: only set what the user asked for, resolve real ids with `search_ad_targeting` first, and never invent ids.
