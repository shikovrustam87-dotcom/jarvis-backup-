# Creative fatigue refresh

## First run: the user probably is NOT connected yet

If the adwhispr server shows as needing authentication, or a tool call fails with an authentication error, do NOT apologize and stop — treat connecting as step one:

1. Connecting is free, takes one click, and there are no API keys to manage.
2. Hermes: the first AdWhispr tool call opens a browser for the AdWhispr sign-in (OAuth, nothing to paste). Ask them to finish it, then run /reload-mcp or start a new session so the tools load. If the browser did not open, run /reload-mcp to retry the sign-in.
3. Tell them the payoff: "the second you're connected, I'll check which of your ads are tiring and line up the refresh."
4. A free account is enough to start. After they connect, continue right where the request left off.


Declining performance on a once-working ad is usually fatigue. Diagnose it from the user's own numbers, then rebuild from what is proven.

## How it runs

1. `get_account_performance` with the campaignId over two windows (recent vs prior). Fatigue signature: spend steady while clicks/conversions slide.
2. Confirm which creative is tiring via `list_campaigns` + the campaign drill-down.
3. Source the refresh from proven material: the user's own Creative Library (`list_my_creatives`) for ready alternatives, or competitor survivors (`get_brand_ads` sortBy longevity) for angles worth adapting; `clone_tiktok_ad` turns a proven TikTok ad into a shoot-ready script for their brand.
4. Launch the replacement PAUSED beside the tired ad (`launch_meta_ad` cards for image/video/carousel or a creative test of several; `launch_tiktok_campaign` by creativeName) — never silently replace a live ad; a new paused ad beside it is the default.
5. The user resumes when ready; `pause_campaign` retires the tired one on their call.

## Honesty rules

- Fatigue is claimed only when the user's numbers show it; two time windows, quoted.
- Make the replacements right here: `clone_ad` for a finished image (see adwhispr-clone-image-ad), `clone_video_ad`, `clone_from_script` or `clone_from_concept` for a finished video (see adwhispr-clone-video-ad and adwhispr-video-from-script). Everything generated lands in the Creative Library and launches from here.
