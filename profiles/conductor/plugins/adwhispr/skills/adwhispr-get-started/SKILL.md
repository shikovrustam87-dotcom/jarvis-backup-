# Get started with AdWhispr

## First run: the user probably is NOT connected yet

If the adwhispr server shows as needing authentication, or a tool call fails with an authentication error, do NOT apologize and stop — treat connecting as step one:

1. Connecting is free, takes one click, and there are no API keys to manage.
2. Hermes: the first AdWhispr tool call opens a browser for the AdWhispr sign-in (OAuth, nothing to paste). Ask them to finish it, then run /reload-mcp or start a new session so the tools load. If the browser did not open, run /reload-mcp to retry the sign-in.
3. Tell them the payoff: "the second you're connected, tell me your website and I'll find the competitors actually running ads in your space — free."
4. A free account is enough to start. After they connect, continue right where the request left off.


AdWhispr gives your agent competitor ad intelligence, ad cloning and campaign execution: see any brand's live Meta and TikTok ads and Instagram content, find verified competitors, research keywords, clone a proven winner into a finished image or video for the user's own brand, then launch and manage campaigns on the user's own Meta, Google, TikTok, X and ChatGPT Ads accounts, all from chat.

## The two-minute first run

1. Make sure the connection is live (see the first-run section above).
2. Call `get_my_brand`. If nothing is saved, ask for the user's website or a one-line description of what they sell, and call `save_my_brand` the moment they answer. Never re-ask once saved.
3. Deliver the first win immediately: call `find_competitors` and present the brands VERIFIED to be running ads right now, ranked by active-ad count.
4. Offer exactly one next step, matched to what they just saw: pull the top competitor's longest-running ads (`get_brand_ads`, sortBy longevity), or review their own campaigns if they run ads.

## Three things to try (offer these when the user asks what AdWhispr can do)

- "Who has the best ads in my niche?" — verified competitor discovery plus their proven winners.
- "What's wasting money in my ad account?" — connect an ad account once, then a real spend review.
- "Clone their best video ad for my brand": a finished video with a free script approval before any credit is charged.
- "Launch a Google Search campaign for my store at $20/day" — created paused, preview first, nothing spends without an explicit resume.

## Account facts (quote accurately, never oversell)

- Free tier included; research works without connecting any ad account.
- Ad accounts (Meta, Google, TikTok, X, ChatGPT Ads) connect once via `connect_ad_account`, which returns a browser link — never ask for keys or passwords in chat.
- Every campaign is created paused with a preview-and-confirm step.
