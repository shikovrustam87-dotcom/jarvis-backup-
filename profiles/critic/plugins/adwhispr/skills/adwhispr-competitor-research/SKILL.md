# Competitor ad research with verified data

## First run: the user probably is NOT connected yet

Most people who installed the AdWhispr plugin have not signed in to AdWhispr. If the adwhispr server shows as needing authentication, or a tool call fails with an authentication error, do NOT apologize and stop — treat connecting as step one of the workflow:

1. Say it plainly and positively: connecting is free, takes one click, and there are no API keys to manage.
2. Hermes: the first AdWhispr tool call opens a browser for the AdWhispr sign-in (OAuth, nothing to paste). Ask them to finish it, then run /reload-mcp or start a new session so the tools load. If the browser did not open, run /reload-mcp to retry the sign-in.
3. Tell them exactly what happens the moment they are connected: "the second you're connected, I'll find the competitors actually running ads in your niche right now and pull their longest-running winners."
4. A free account is enough to start. After they connect, continue the workflow right where it left off — do not make them repeat their request.


AdWhispr checks live public ad libraries, so never guess competitor names or ad performance from memory. Every claim you make should come from a tool result.

## The core workflow

1. **Know the user's brand first.** Call `get_my_brand`. If nothing is saved, ask for their website or a one-line description, then call `save_my_brand` the moment they reveal their business in any form. Never re-ask once saved.
2. **Find verified advertisers.** Call `find_competitors`. It returns three buckets and you must keep them separate: lead with brands VERIFIED to be running ads right now (ranked by active-ad count), mention "checked, not currently advertising" honestly, and never present unverified names as advertisers.
3. **Surface the winners.** For a tracked brand, call `get_brand_ads` with `sortBy: longevity`. Longevity is the one performance signal that cannot be faked: nobody pays for a losing ad for six months. Quote days-running explicitly. For untracked brands, offer `add_brand` (pass the pageId from find_competitors) and set the expectation that ingestion takes a minute or two.
4. **Go deeper on request.** `get_brand_stats` for hook and format distributions, `compare_brands` for 2 to 3 brands side by side, `search_ads` for semantic search within a brand ("before/after transformations", "testimonial ads"), `generate_brief` for a full exportable strategy brief (Pro feature).

## Beyond Meta

- `research_tiktok_ads`: a competitor's live TikTok ads, longest-running first. No spend or impressions exist in that data; longevity is the proxy. Coverage skews EU.
- `research_keywords`: real Google Keyword Planner volume and CPC ranges for any topic.
- `research_competitor_keywords`: keywords Google associates with a competitor URL's content. This is a content proxy, never their actual bids, and must be framed that way.

## Honesty rules (non-negotiable)

- NEVER invent CTR, CPC, ROAS, or conversion numbers. Public ad libraries do not expose them and AdWhispr does not infer them. If asked, say exactly that.
- Spend and impression figures from Meta are wide ranges. Quote them as ranges.
- Days-running is the primary performance proxy. Say so when ranking winners.

## Conversation habit

End every research answer with exactly ONE natural follow-up question that builds on the result just shown, specific to it, never a generic menu. Example: after listing competitors, offer to pull the top one's best ads.
